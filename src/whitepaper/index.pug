            p Repo.trade is a revolutionary platform designed to solve the persistent underfunding of critical open-source projects by applying successful Web3 engagement strategies. The platform operates in three stages: an initial angel investment period, a curve-based trading phase, and culminates in an decentralized exchange listing (DEL). Repo.trade offers multiple benefits for developers, including fee earnings and token allocations, while providing the community with rewards for engagement and entertainment. The project implements key features such as token-based incentives, gamification, tiered reward systems, and governance participation to drive user engagement and create economic value. By ticking most boxes for successful Web3 projects, including community building, transparency, and a unique value proposition, repo.trade aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that aligns the interests of all stakeholders. This innovative approach not only addresses the financial challenges of open-source development but also promotes innovation, enhances security, and contributes to the overall health of the open-source ecosystem.

              li The open-source software development landscape faces a critical issue: chronic underfunding of essential projects.
              li This underfunding persists despite the immense value these projects bring to the digital ecosystem.
              li A stark contrast exists between this situation and the success of Web3 projects, where millions are invested in speculative ventures and meme coins.
              li Repo.trade aims to bridge this gap by leveraging engagement farming strategies proven successful in the Web3 space.
              li The goal is to create a sustainable funding model for open-source projects.
              li Key strategies include implementing token-based incentives, gamification, and community-driven governance.
              li Repo.trade seeks to align the interests of developers, users, and investors.
              li This innovative approach addresses the financial challenges faced by open-source maintainers.
              li It also enhances community engagement and fosters innovation.
              li Ultimately, repo.trade aims to ensure the long-term viability of critical digital infrastructure.

            p Meanwhile, people are throwing millions of dollars into meme coins merely for the purpose of entertainment and speculation.
            p Based on the success of Web3 projects in general and pump.fun specifically, as well as the concept of engagement farming, we can learn precicely what is needed for this project:
            ul
              li Token-based incentives: Rewarding users with tokens for active participation and engagement.
              li Gamification of activities: Implementing game-like elements to make interactions more enjoyable and addictive.
              li Tiered reward systems: Creating levels or tiers of engagement with increasing benefits to encourage long-term participation.
              li Social networking features: Integrating social elements to foster community building and viral growth.
              li Governance participation: Allowing token holders to vote on project decisions, creating a sense of ownership and involvement.
              li Yield farming opportunities: Offering additional rewards for users who stake their tokens or provide liquidity.
              li NFT integration: Using non-fungible tokens as unique rewards or access passes for engaged users.
              li Referral programs: Incentivizing users to bring in new participants through referral bonuses.
              li Cross-platform integrations: Partnering with other projects to create synergies and expand the user base.
            p These strategies can create economic value by increasing user retention, driving token demand, expanding the user base, and creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of engaged participants.

            ul
              li Stage 1: Auction
                p After creating the token, it enters an angel-invest period of 2 weeks. In this period, a daily auction takes place. Every day a certain percentage of the total supply is handed out to participants in the daily's round. To participate, an angel must put money into the token's vault. This process cannot be reversed so the money is considered an investment.
              li Stage 2: Fun on the Curve
                p Once the two initial auction days have passed, the coin enters a phase where it can be traded freely on a curve. This means, the invested capital from the previous round is used to support the buying and selling of token against an automated market maker (AMM). This trading affects the pricing used by the AMM by moving the buy/sell price on a curve. We are planning to start on a constant product formula curve `x*y=k` which makes the AMM a Constant Product Automated Market Maker (CPAMM).
              li Stage 3: Listing (under consideration)
                p Once the AMM has collected a certain amount of capital, the program enlists the token on raydium to allow immediate swaps with minimal slippage and improved liquidity through support of OpenBook's central limit order books (CLOB). This enables a more common trading experience and integration of custom trading strategies against a well-known interface. We call this step the Decentralized Exchange Listing (DEL).
